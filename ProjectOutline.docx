The widespread use of the internet has given rise to media and with it the use of social media platforms for everyday use. 
Using social media has kept people updated faster nowadays than TV channels and newspapers can keep up with. 
This is because of how fast data can change and with it the news. This also then gives rise to rumors and fake news.

The purpose of this project is to create an NLP model that can classify fake news as true or false. 
The use of python libraries to perform tokenization and extraction  of text data as well as 
selection methods will be able to show the best fit features of the model to obtain its highest precision.
