# Detection of Fake News using NLP
The widespread use of the internet has given rise to media and with it the use of social media platforms for everyday use. Using social media has kept people updated faster nowadays than TV channels and newspapers can keep up with. This is because of how fast data can change and with it the news. This also then gives rise to rumors and fake news.
This project is to use NLP to separate fake news from real ones as the internet is constantly updating and keeping up with news and rumors is no easy task.
This document lists the following files for the project demo.

# 1. Project Outline and its purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an NLP model that can classify fake news as true or false. The use of python libraries to perform tokenization and extraction of text data as well as selection methods will be able to show the best fit features of the model to obtain its highest precision.

# 2. Dataset
The dataset News.csv originally taken from Kaggle is linked as a GDrive link below

# 3. Code
The code for this project is in an .ipynb format.

# 4. Performance Analysis/Accuracy
There are five models that have been chosen to work on the news dataset. This segment will compare the performances of these models and will choose the best one for the application by their accuracy.

# 5. Explanation
This segment will talk about the five models we have chosen to compare and choose them by accuracy and explain the best one that fits this dataset.

# 6. Conclusion
Dicussing the results of our project, there will be indications of what is to come next and what future applications our project can be used for.

# 7. Project File
The finalised project file with all the relevant details will be uploaded in a .docx format.
