The product model will test the unseen data, the results will be plotted, and accordingly, 
the product will be a model that detects and classifies fake articles and can be used and integrated with any system for future use. 


Our experiments demonstrate that a machine learning model using NLP techniques can effectively detect fake news articles. 
The results suggest that incorporating word embeddings can improve the performance of the model, 
and sentiment analysis may not be a crucial feature for fake news detection. 

Future research can explore other feature extraction techniques and evaluate the model's performance on a larger and more diverse dataset.
